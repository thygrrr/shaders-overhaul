Shader's Overhaul, Improved
===========================
(aka Shader's Overhaul, Rough)

This is a simple mod. It is a replacement Water Shader for the Age of Sail MMORPG **Pirates of the Burning Sea.**

* Changes Open Seas Water (primarily)
* Changes Avcom and Port Water (slightly)
* Changes Login and Avatar Screen Water (slightly)

Come play the Game at [BurningSea.com](https://play.burningsea.com) and sink me on Roberts (any French named RÃ©nardblanc) and Antigua (any Spaniard named Herradura)

Installing
----------
Simply [download a release](https://github.com/thygrrr/shaders-overhaul/releases) and open the .msi and point the installation wizard to your PotBS install (the directory where PotBS.exe is)

If you Update PotBS, BitRaider may overwrite this file. In case it stops working, open control panel or the .msi again, navigate to the Shader's Overhaul, Improved entry in the software list, and choose Modify/Repair.

Note: *Shader's Overhaul, Improved will not turn your French 'van Hoorn' Snow into a Spanish 'Mediator' Cutter, promised!*

Building
---------
Included is a simple .aip for [Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com). It may be obsolete by now. All it does is overwrite the ```viewspaceOcean.hlsl``` shader in the games's ```shaders_fx``` folder.
