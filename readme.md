Shader's Overhaul, Improved
===========================
(aka Shader's Overhaul, Rough)

This is a simple mod. It is a replacement Water Shader for the Age of Sail MMORPG **Pirates of the Burning Sea.**

* Changes Open Seas Water (primarily)
* Changes Avcom and Port Water (slightly, usually for the better as well)

Play the Game at [BurningSea.com](https://play.burningsea.com)

Installing
----------
Simply [download a release](https://github.com/thygrrr/shaders-overhaul/releases) and open the .msi and point the installation wizard to your PotBS install (the directory where PotBS.exe is)

If you Update PotBS, BitRaider may overwrite this file. In case it stops working, open control panel or the .msi again, navigate to the Shader's Overhaul, Improved entry in the software list, and choose Modify/Repair.

Building
---------
Included is a simple .aip for [Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com). It may be obsolete by now. All it does is overwrite the ```viewspaceOcean.hlsl``` shader in the games's ```shaders_fx``` folder.
